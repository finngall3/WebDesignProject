      <h1>Nottingham Forest: First Leg 3-0</h1>
      <p>Upon reaching the Semi-Finals of the Carabao Cup, the two teams drawn
        together must play each other twice over two legs, both home and away.
        United drew against fellow Premier League team Nottingham Forest.
        Forest were much lower in the table than United however, and were in a worse 
        run of form. But as they made it to the late stages of a cup competition, 
        they had every intention of going in it to win it.
        Within the opening 6 minutes of the game, United's star player
        Marcus Rashford had opened the scoring. This was followed on with goals 
        from their new striker on loan from Burnley, Wout Weghorst 
        in the 45th minute, scoring his first goal for United in this game,
         and team captain Bruno Fernandes in the 89th minute.

      <h1>Second Leg: 2-0</h1>
      <p>United came into the second leg with 3 goals to nil on aggeragate
        and were confident to add to their tally. Forest were well and truly the underdogs
        and sure enough. United were able to comfortably beat them again with 
        goals from Anthony Martial and Fred in the 73rd and 76th minutes
        respectively
